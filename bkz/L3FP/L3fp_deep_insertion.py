	"""Executes the floating-point LLL deep insertion algorithm as presented in:
	Lattice Basis Reduction: Improved Practical Algorithms and Solving Subset Sum Problems
	by C. P. Schnorr and M. Euchner.

	This variant of LLL reduction operates on a matrix that includes an injected short vector
	(e.g., from an SVP solver), which introduces linear dependencies. The algorithm performs
	deep insertion to optimally reorder the basis vectors and maintain reduction quality.

	During execution, one of the column vectors in `injected_basis_matrix` will become a zero vector
	as a result of the linear dependencies. This zero vector is detected and removed from `injected_basis_matrix`.


	Args:
		injected_basis_matrix (np.ndarray):
			A 2D NumPy array of shape (n, m), where n<=m, representing a modified lattice basis matrix
	        that includes an injected short (column) vector.

		gs_coeff_matrix (np.ndarray):
			A 2D NumPy array of shape (n, m), where n<=m, representing the Gram-Schmidt coefficients
	        of the injected_basis_matrix.

		gs_squared_norms (np.ndarray):
	                1D NumPy array of shape (m,) representing the squared lengths of the
	        Gram-Schmidt vectors.

		start_stage (int):
			The index of the injected_basis_matrix column from which the reduction process begins.

		Lovasz_cond_param (float):
			The Lovasz condition parameter (typically in ]1/2, 1[) used to determine
			whether a re-order is necessary during the deep insertion loop at each stage.

		f_c (bool):
			A flag used to track floating-point precision issues. If set to True and a precision flaw
			is detected, the algorithm will backtrack one step or restart from stage 1.

	Returns:
		(tuple):
			-injected_basis_matrix (np.ndarray):
				A 2D NumPy array of shape (n, n) representing the reduced matrix after deep insertion, with the zero vector removed.

			-gs_coeff_matrix (np.ndarray):
				A 2D Numpy array of shape (n, n) representing the updated Gram-Schmidt coefficients.

			-gs_squared_norms (np.ndarray):
				A 1D Numpy array of shape (n,) representing the updated squared lengths of The Gram-Schmidt vectors.
