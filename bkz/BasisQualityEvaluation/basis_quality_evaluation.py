def compute_basis_quality_characteristics(basis, reduced):
	"""Computes key quality metrics for a lattice basis.
	This function evaluates the shortest vector norm, Hermite factor, and
	orthogonality defect for a given lattice basis. If the basis is not reduced,
	column norms are sorted to provide a more meaningful comparison.

	Args:
	    basis (np.ndarray):
	        A 2D NumPy array of shape (n, n) representing the lattice basis.

	    reduced (bool):
	        Indicates whether the basis is already reduced. If False, column norms
	        are sorted before computing metrics.

	Returns:
	    (list): A list containing Shortest column norm (float), Hermite factor (float), Orthogonality defect (float).
